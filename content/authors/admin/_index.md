I am Mayank Sharma, a passionate roboticist with a strong background in robotics and computer vision, currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Robotics at the University of Maryland, College Park. My expertise lies in developing autonomous systems, designing algorithms for robot navigation, and optimizing 3D reconstruction techniques. My recent experiences include working as a Computer Vision Engineer Intern at Kick Robotics, where I contributed to the development of an autonomous mobile robot for warehouse exploration and carbon monoxide level monitoring. I also gained substantial research experience at the Robotics Algorithms & Autonomous Systems Lab, focusing on Next-Best-View (NBV) planning and deep learning techniques for object mapping.

During my undergraduate studies at NMIMS University, I worked on innovative projects like designing a novel UAV docking mechanism at IIT Bombay, which significantly enhanced UAV flight time. I am proficient in Python, C++, and MATLAB, with a strong command of tools like ROS2, NAV2, OpenCV, and PyTorch. My passion for robotics drives me to continually explore new challenges in Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, and Path Planning. I am actively seeking full-time robotics opportunities starting in September 2024.
